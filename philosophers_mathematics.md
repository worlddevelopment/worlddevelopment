How does what I do help the world? (Pay attention to not interpret this egoistically, it is not only about *your* world.)
===

Example:

A man suppresses a woman.

The man asks himself:
"How does it help the world?"
And answers to himself:
"Of course, it helps *my* world, because I can use her for some things. Therefore it must help the world, because the world contains many individuals' worlds, so my world too and because my world is improved, the overall world is helped too."

Now this kind of thinking has a problem, because it does not follow mathematics correctly. The world of the suppressed woman has been neglected, i.e. been excluded from the equation.

So the man continues:
"Now my world is improved in a way. But how about the world of the woman?"

After some time thinking, he concludes:
"Okay, the woman's world is less important and her world isn't really destroyed, I just use her sometimes, else she can move freely within the house. So the overall benefit for the world wins."


This exposes several problems, the most important one the lack of giving reasons, which might have made the man realize them.
The assumption that the woman's world isn't destroyed, has no underlying reasons. While assumptions about another individual's world are possible, it's never possible give the own world more importance than the other.
This problem has another wording: Egoism.
The man thinks his benefits must outweigh the pitfalls for the woman. It's nothing else than stating oneself is more important than another person. This is unethical. Imagine you'd be alone in this world, completely alone, no slaves, no workers, no friends, no other people at all, not even animals, no plants, ... just you.

Now the man realizes that and doesn't want to be an ego-centric person:
"So the woman's world is of equal if not even of higher importance than my own world. Now if her world really is destroyed, the overall result is a worse overall world, because while my world is improved a bit, her world is destroyed."

After some time, the man reconsiders:
"Wait. *If* her world is destroyed. That's not really the case, she gets to eat and drink, and sometimes she even is allowed to get some money to buy things for me. So what if her world suffers less than my world benefits from her being my slave?"

This uncovers another problem.
Does the woman's world suffer less than the world of the man on the brink of an important decision?

This problem isn't really a problem. This case is covered already because noone has the rights to decide about the grade of how much a world of another individual benefits or suffers. An objective comparison is impossible, which leads to a subjective decision, that most often leads to an unhelpful result due to egoism.
Therefore because an objective comparison is impossible, the man sees:
"Hm... I can't get to an objective result. Hence it's impossible to say that the benefit of my world is greater than the pitfalls for her world. Therefore I can't enslave her."
The answer seems obvious to the man:
"But she could enslave herself. So I'll just convince her to do so. I just must increase the pressure and ask other men to help. They'll get a reward. Maybe money, or I borrow them our girls or give them as present ..."

This is yet another problem that terrorizes the world.
The man even may like to be borrowed himself for such purposes, such that he thinks it's not a problem at all, because his argumentation contains nothing but assumptions and guesses steered by subjective imagination. He has no real experience of what he is talking about, because he surely wasn't borrowed and certainly not as a girl because he is a man - and not as the girl he plans to lend away.

Now the man has enough and remembers that he doesn't want to make this world a worse, but a better place, because finally it's not about himself, becaues if he'd be entirely alone in a dead world, how horrible that must be, so better don't influence other people's worlds.
"It's their decisions and it must be a free decision, not steered, forced or influenced otherwise."

After thinking more about it, the man starts to like the thought that maybe some time he'd find a person that wanted to be with him,  to make this world a better place - together.

He concludes:
"Instead of influencing other people's life, maybe even destroying it, even if accidentally, how could I really help making this world a better place, preventing conflict and suffering?"
