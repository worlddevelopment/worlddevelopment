Development standards
===

Why standards
---
A multifaceted development of such large scale and so many different technologies, software and hardware modules all interacting and depending on each other requires solutions to tough problems like verdicts against single source principle and thus information redundancy that is easy to diverge easily which leads to conflicts as to know which is the most recent version.

When imagining this happening thousands of times, the tremendous scale of the problem becomes apparent.

Therefore to allow effective, consistent and steady world development fixing such issues required thinking power of several years.


The standards
---
Adhering to the following standards partly or entirely fixes most development issues, therefore ensures automatic, consistent, consequent development without data entropy getting out of control:


* [Every part its own `<part>`.blend grouped as "Group" => Fulfill single source principle, Automate dependency, URI reference handling](https://github.com/faerietree/multimachine_lightspeed_precise/issues/1)

* [Only stable parameters like e.g. dimensions, IDs in URI / file names. Prevent price, URL, ...](https://github.com/faerietree/gears_maedler/issues/1)

* [Give values in SI units and omit the unit](https://github.com/faerietree/universal_prototyping_kit/issues/4)
