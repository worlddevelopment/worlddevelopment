Roadmap
===

*For the goals we bake, the best and simplest (yet ethical) solutions we take.*


Current focus/effort for the fulfillment of an excerpt of the worlddevelopment goals:


* Universal technology (pivot), universally trainable:
  * 1%, <a href="https://github.com/worlddevelopment/universal_automata">Universal automata</a>

* Increase living standards:
  * 45%, <a href="https://github.com/worlddevelopment/electricity_from_stream">Electricity from stream</a>.
  * 20%, <a href="https://github.com/worlddevelopment/electricity_from_airflow">Electricity from wind</a>.

* Increase education:
  * 90%: Teacher project (portable online, offline exercise, sheet, exam and reference solution sharing system),
  * .2%: 0BC Time Machine (educational history teaching simulation of the world starting in stone age and before to learn about formation of the planet(s) and life).
  * High efficiency language learning apparatus that trains you by the way (e.g. robot, transport vehicle or other mobile tech).

* Toolset/Toolchains:
  * 90%, mechanical design tools (blender + extension development).
  * 90%, computer aided manufacturing (blender + extensions)
  * 75%, mechanics documentation tools (blender + extensions)
  * 1%, interconnectable engineering toolbox, still need to evaluate Octave - or how quickly OpenFOAM source code can be studied to add all the missing math there. Refs #1.
