As the rewards in relation to the work conditions are epic because it is freedom to follow interest, any progress / work done  depends entirely on the being's motivation, i.e. the interest, thus the following jobs are extremely difficult to fill.

`Direct applications will be ignored.` Use collaboration as a means of entry.

One may be asked when there is trust, confidence to a degree of true mutual friendship.

This guarantees that a significant amount of heartily open source or wonderful artistic contributions and collaboration (direct or indirectly with worlddevelopment) are required before there will be chances to get one of the jobs.


    There is no rush for the worlddevelopment club to fill the job.


*(Nevertheless it is not labelled `dream job` because that depends: it may also be out of uber propel, i.e. wanting to be useful and help make the world an epic place without this process necessarily being perceived as fun. e.g. for many developers of technology -- despite our attitude towards simple, straight forward solutions -- it is just a nasty (non-natural), labor intense, tedious means to create an epic world. So the result can be great, but the way often is stony. Candidatures should be aware of that crushing fact.)*
